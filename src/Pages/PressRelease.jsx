                OneSimCard M2M / IoT announced today the release of a new
                solution for its global IoT SIM card clientele. The new OneSim
                IMEI Lock service adds a layer of security and assures that an
                IoT SIM card can only be used in the IoT device to which it is
                assigned. OneSim IMEI Lock allows the user to link OneSimCard
                M2M's international data IoT SIM to a particular IoT device by using
                the device's unique IMEI number. Locking an IoT SIM card to a
                singular device can be critical to IoT security & can prevent
                significant financial losses, especially for international IoT SIM
                card deployments. Companies using IoT SIM cards need to make certain
                that the IoT SIM card cannot be taken from the IoT unit and
                installed into another device (think Smartphone or Tablet) which
                may use considerably more data. OneSim IMEI Lock is also crucial
                to ensure data being collected is accurately tied to the device
                sending it. With the continued surge of IoT devices being
                deployed globally, having this additional layer of IoT SIM security
                is pivotal{" "}

            "Security has always been paramount to OneSimCard M2M / IoT and OneSim IMEI Lock is yet another component which adds to the many IoT SIM card security features offered to its clients. OneSimCard M2M / IoT offers Private (Custom) APN, VPN (both IP-SEC VPN and Open VPN), & Peer-to-Peer connections using Private Static IPs. All of these features are designed to keep IoT data secure and to ensure that IoT devices are less likely to be hacked. Many other important features designed specifically for IoT are available including: API’s for IoT SIM management, a single APN for all IoT SIM cards deployed worldwide, OSCAR portal for IoT SIM management, and the list goes on",
            "The OneSim IMEI Lock solution is designed to be user friendly unlike many IMEI SIM locks offered by other IoT SIM providers where users have to call support and get permission to lock or unlock an IoT SIM. Locking and unlocking the IoT SIM with OneSim IMEI Lock is extremely simple and is completed in seconds with just a few clicks of the mouse using OneSimCard's OSCAR portal for IoT SIM card management and reporting. Because the OSCAR portal is completely online, users can change their IoT SIM lock settings anywhere in the world, and even on their Android Smartphone through OneSimCard M2M's IoT App available on Google Play Store (iOS 1SIM IoT app is coming soon).",
            "During our interview with OneSimCard’s CEO, Alex Filippov, Mr. Filippov said, “OneSim IMEI Lock is an exciting addition to the vast array of IoT SIM card functionality that we offer. We are continually listening to our customers and adding features which are important to them. Our customers range from 2 person start-ups to Fortune 500 and large Public Sector organizations. Having such a diverse customer base and our ability to stay nimble allows us to adjust and add features quickly which will have the greatest impact to the largest breadth of customers.” Mr. Filippov went on to say, “The OneSim IMEI Lock is just the start of new functionality we will be releasing in the next year. 2020 is going to be an incredible year at OneSimCard M2M / IoT and we are looking forward to releasing several new features for our global IoT SIM cards.",
